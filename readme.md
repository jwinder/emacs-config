# .emacs.d

Taken from [rubbish](https://github.com/rubbish/rubbish-emacs-setup).

Here are a few common packages that you might need (you might need others):

    apt-get install -y libgtk2.0-dev libXpm-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libgif-dev libtiff-dev libncurses-dev markdown texinfo git subversion cvs rubygems rake
    gem install rake

Either download & install emacs:
* download [emacs 24.x](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), `./configure`, `make`, `sudo make install`

Or use your package manager:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cassou/emacs
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install emacs24

And then:
* clone this repo to `$HOME/.emacs.d`
* run emacs
* ???
* profit!
